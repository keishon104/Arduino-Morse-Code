Arduino Morse Code Project 
Created by Keishon Smith September 10, 2016
 
Purpose: 
	In some situations commuicating through audio is either difficult or impossible. The benefit of using light to communicate is
that it travels the same speed through any minimum. Communicating is an important part of society and is usually expressed through 
language which is essentially a agreed upon collection of sounds that represent some type of meaning or concept. In a way this program 
is a tranlator of two languages English and Morse Code. In 1836, Samuel Morse demonstated the ability of a telegraph system to transmit 
information over wires. Using electric signals, dits and dahs(dots and dashes) messages were able to be sent throughout the world. This
program is meant to allow users to input messages into the serial communications window and have the message output through a LED.
